- Delete the noice by focusing on the eye itself or just the area surrounding the eye
- Turn the image into a threshold image
- Find the darkest spot around the eye which is the pupil
- Reduce the noice around the pupil so there is only one dark spot

- Find/Set the middle point of the pupil
====================================================================================
THE PROBLEM:
Calculate the displacement of the pupil from the middle by measuring the distance between the mid point coordinates 
and to the point where the pupil is located.
The displacement found is in the radian measurement and the angle between the vision sight and the mid point.
Calculate the full field of vision of the person.
