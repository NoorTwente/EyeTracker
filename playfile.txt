Do we need to load all the files in the filepage? This would ensure that there is no latency on listening to the file. However, this wouldtake a huge amount of storage because all the file has to be loaded up on the page. Instead, if we just keep it to the cloud and only load the filenames to the app then app would be lighter in a sense that it will take less space. We can load/download the file whenever someone wants to listen to it. However, We have to look into how much time it takes for the app to load from the database. If it is under 0.1 sec for big files then it's not a problem or else we have to implement a downloadable function for the files which downloads/loads the file and then the user can listen to it.
